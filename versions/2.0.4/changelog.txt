# This Week in Velmoria
## Update 2.0.4

Greetings, Seeker.
This week in Velmoria, we’re rolling out Update 2.0.4! This update requires a full config refresh (sorry).

**Let’s get into it.**

## Update 2.0.4 – Changes
### General
- Fixed a CCA:World version mismatch between Resurgence Core and BOMD.
- Dimension access is now dependent on a series of factors, usually an advancement requirement.
- Bestiary now correctly shows discovered mobs.
- Edicts now grant advancement rewards as well as modifiers!
- Removed MCDW as there were just too many melee weapons in the game.
- Fixed cow, sheep, pig and spider textures.
- Updated Too Many Bows loot tables.
- Level unlock screen now groups by equipment type, then mod, then slot.
- Added background texture for the player title screen.
- Now player name displays by default, press ] to toggle this.
- Boss bars are now toggleable with the [-] key.
- Fixed an animation bug with bows.
- Bows now require you to aim to shoot, right click aim, left click fire.

### Class Changes
- Huge changes for ranged in this update, we've been looking at some of the weapons available, and it's not good enough.
    - Ranged users are getting a big boost in variety with the addition of Too Many Bows.

- New Class: **Berserker**
    - The berserker spell book is unlocked at level 60 and enables high damage using Rage power.
    - This is meant to be an option for melee users at high levels, as other styles have high level options too.

### Levelling
- Level sync finally works! Reads data from puffish and throws out any regressive level updates.
- Dimensions are now locked behind level requirements (among other things).
- Adjusted level requirements for all elytra types.
- Level caps have changed slightly in this update. New level caps are as follows:
    - 20 for all players at base level.
    - 35 after defeating the Forsaken Magus.
    - 40 after defeating the Gauntlet.
    - 65 after defeating the Ender Dragon.
    - 99 after defeating Conjunctivius.

- Added Level requirements to the following mods:
    - Spellblades and Such
    - Simply Swords (Uniques)
    - Berserkers
    - Too Many Bows
    - Mythic Metals (Armor)
    - Dungeon Now Loading
