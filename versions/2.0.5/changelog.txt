# This Week in Velmoria
## Update 2.0.5

Greetings, Seeker.
This week in Velmoria, we’re rolling out Update 2.0.5, and it's all about making the menus more cohesive.
You can access your player profile by clicking on the level in your inventory. Titles are also getting a be overhaul with
a fully redesigned UI, cleaner progression and unlock logic.

**Let’s get into it.**

## Patch Highlights
- **New Player Profile Hub:** Access a centralized profile screen showing your rotating character model, active title, and quick navigation to all major menus.
- **Titles System Overhaul:** Complete redesign of the titles UI with categories, search functionality, and configurable display modes. Titles now appear above your name!
- **UI Consistency Pass:** Lore Book, Level Unlocks, and Titles screens all share a cohesive book-style design with proper navigation.
- **Quality of Life:** Fixed level display bugs, removed spam effects, and streamlined the player experience across worlds.

## Changes
### Player Profile
- Accessed from the inventory screen, the profile screen shows a rotating model of your player, with your name and current active title, and a set of navigation buttons to other menus.
- This acts as a hub for all the relevant menus in the modpack.
- Access your Level Unlocks, Title Selection, Lore Book, Statistics, and Advancements all from one place.
- Hover over your character model to view detailed stats and progression.
- Your equipped armor and items are fully visible on the rotating model.

### UI
- Lore Book has a new design, it's a bit more book-like.
- Level unlocks and titles screen brought in line with the new lore book design.
- Added a settings page for displaying titles.
- Added proper textures and navigation buttons (forward/back arrows).
- Stats tooltip now shows correct level when switching worlds/servers.
- Level-up effects don't spam when joining a world with higher level.
- Legitimate level-ups still trigger effects properly.
- Removed reputation from the stats tooltip, pledges are still present.
- English is now the only language available (due to the many custom font overrides, sorry).

### Titles
- Titles now display above your name unless set to icon-only mode (toggled in title settings).
- All titles are categorized and earnable in various ways:
    - **Player Level:** Through level-ups, every 3 levels.
    - **Bosses:** Killing bosses grants a title to show your progress.
    - **Story:** Available on the SMP, given at certain points in the story as quest rewards.
    - **Items:** Given after obtaining certain items.
    - **Events:** Complete seasonal content in the pack during holiday events.
    - **Special:** Other titles that don't fit into the other categories.

    - Category list view showing all title categories.
