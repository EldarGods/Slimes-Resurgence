# Update 1.4
Today the Slimes Resurgence beta launches with update v1.4!

# Quests & Story Campaign
Guide yourself through the modpack with quests, including the story campaign†
The campaign unlocks progressively as you play, it's tied to both the story and lore, but also your progression.

# The Talent Tree
Make your own class with the Talent Tree. Current implemented features include:
- 10 Fates
- 16 Passive Talents
- 5 Active Abilities
- 100 Stat Changes

This allows you to make your own class, with a unique talent, build and gear.
## Level up your character
Level up and grow stronger with the new leveling system. Earn talent points every two levels, fight against enemies from your level, and much more! (This includes support for mob scaling). Your player level is displayed in the inventory.

# Overhauled Design
Slimes Resurgence has its own unique look and feel, the pack has its own style, including custom GUI, textures and a fancy new hotbar!

# Heroic Challenges
## Endgame boss encounters
Test your limits and fight bosses on Heroic difficulty with infinite scaling!
You begin at Heroic I, then climb a ladder, fighting random and harder bosses with affixes.

If you or your teammate die, the challenge will end and your heroic level will be reduced.

## Performance Changes
Improved heavy load times
Fixed lag spikes upon opening the questbook for the first time


**See you soon, world guardians**
