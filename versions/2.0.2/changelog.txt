# This Week in Velmoria
## Update 2.0.2

Greetings, Seeker.
This week in Velmoria, we’re rolling out Update 2.0.2, a focused quality-of-life and balance patch aimed at tightening progression rules, improving UI clarity, and addressing several long-standing edge cases.
This update also includes seasonal flair for the Festival of Glacis, alongside important SMP and balance adjustments.

**Let’s get into it.**

## Patch Highlights
- A full overhaul of the Level Unlock Screen, now clearer, cleaner, and including boss levels.
- Progression rules are now fully enforced, even in creative mode.
- Multiple exploits around armor equipping have been closed.
- Seasonal festivities continue—Creepers are once again embracing Glacis fashion.
- Several problematic items have been disabled to stabilize balance going forward.

## Update 2.0.2 – Changes
### General
- Updated pack icon and window icon.
- Blocks can no longer be broken without the required level, including in creative mode.
- Armor can no longer be equipped without meeting its level requirement, including being:
    - Shift-clicked
    - Manually placed
    - Right-click equipped

- Fixed an IllegalStateException caused by removing entities from teams they were never part of.
- Creepers will wear Santa hats for the remainder of the Festival of Glacis.
- Completely redesigned Level Unlock Screen.

### Progression Updates
Level requirements have been added for content from:
- Paradise Lost

- Companions
- Simply Swords (no uniques yet)
- Mythic Metals (no armor yet)

**These changes bring all major gear sources in line with Velmoria’s intended progression curve.**

### Known Issues
- Armor may appear to disappear when right-clicked without the required level.
- This is visual only—the item is not lost and will reappear appropriately.
