# This Week in Velmoria
## Update 2.0.3

Greetings, Seeker.
This week in Velmoria, Update 2.0.3 has been about discipline—of systems, of progression, and of presentation.
Update 2.0.3 is less about flashy additions and more about ensuring the world behaves with intent, clarity, and narrative weight.

## Patch Highlights
- Finally fixed the level desync on rejoining a world or server.
- Players can unlock titles through various conditions and display them in chat and above their heads.
- Made improvements to the Lore Book screen, pulling it in line with Edicts and Level Requirements.

**Let’s get into it.**

One of the most immediately noticeable changes is to Titles. The selection screen has been refined so that titles finally feel like named honors rather than anonymous icons.
Each title now presents itself clearly, with its name rendered alongside its symbol, spaced and aligned to read naturally.
Hovering over entries is smoother and more informative and the currently equipped title stands out without ambiguity.
It is a small change in scope, but one that reinforces identity—who your character is, and what they’ve earned.

Progression itself has taken a decisive turn toward story-driven structure. Levels are no longer an open-ended climb.
Instead, advancement is now bound to where you stand in Velmoria’s unfolding narrative. For now, the road ends at level 20.
When that limit is reached, experience no longer spills uselessly into the void; it is clamped cleanly, and the game tells you exactly why you cannot progress and what must be done to move forward.
In some cases, brute force will not suffice—bosses, not grinding, may hold the key. This change lays the groundwork for future chapters, where progression is earned through moments, not hours.

Under the surface, a great deal of technical debt has finally been paid. Several long-standing issues with XP calculation and synchronization have been resolved.
Levels no longer reset on server restart. Client and server now agree on how XP is calculated and interpreted, using a unified, cumulative XP table rather than mismatched assumptions.
Progress bars now tell the truth, reflecting real thresholds instead of misleading estimates.
For those who reach the true peak, the game now acknowledges it plainly: MAX LEVEL is no longer a rumor.

The world itself has gained a touch of menace. Creatures no longer simply appear—they rise.
New spawn animations pull mobs from the earth, giving encounters a brief, unsettling moment of anticipation.
Alongside this, item and mob tiers have been standardized to align cleanly with Tierify, ensuring consistency across the modpack and eliminating edge-case confusion.
The modpack has also been trimmed and reinforced. Several mods have been updated to stabilize the experience, while others have been removed where they no longer fit the direction of the pack.
New additions, such as Respawn Obelisks and Tierify integrations, support the long-term vision of structured progression and meaningful recovery rather than punishment.

There are still rough edges. Shields are currently more permissive than intended, and progression beyond level 20 is intentionally sealed until the next stage of the story is ready.
But this update was never about pushing forward recklessly. It was about narrowing the path, making sure that when Velmoria asks you to advance, it does so with purpose.

**The world is quieter now—but only because it is preparing to speak more clearly in the weeks ahead.**
